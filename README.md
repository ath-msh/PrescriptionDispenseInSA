# PrescriptionDispenseInSA
Design and implementation of prescription system using solidityâ€™s language 
Medical centers' dispensation of controlled medicine to patients continues to utilize handwritten paperwork to record controlled drug manufacture, distribution, prescription, administration, and disposal, causing system delays. Particularly, this may be a reason to circumvent, manipulate the system or write undocumented, standardized prescriptions for the patient that may have a negative impact on the patient. The main concept is that smart contracts are a solid foundation for any blockchain development project, by describing the design and implementation of the prescription distribution approach that manages different participants in related sectors.
Furthermore, developing secured smart contracts is critical for the healthcare system's security and privacy. This study presents a proposal and implementation for the prescribed immutable and authenticated prescription for patients suffering from chronic disease and need ongoing dispense on regular bases. By employing smart contracts based on blockchain, we attempt to clarify the benefits of using this technology in the prescription system in Saudi Arabia and address the ability of smart contracts to provide security for applications.
The findings contribute in several ways to our understanding of smart contracts and provide a basis for building a secure prescription dispenser approach that serves the healthcare sector.
